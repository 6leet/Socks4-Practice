# Introduction
Implement the SOCKS 4/4A protocol in the application layer of the OSI model.
SOCKS is similar to a proxy (i.e., intermediary-program) that acts as both server and client for the purpose of making requests on behalf of other clients. Because the SOCKS protocol is independent of application protocols, it can be used for many different services: telnet, ftp, WWW, etc.
Implement both types of the SOCKS operations, namely CONNECT and BIND.
